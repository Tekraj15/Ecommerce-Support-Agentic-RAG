## Features ‚ú®
- **Order Tracking**: "Where is my order #123?" ‚Üí Real-time status from FakeStore API.
- **Product Stock Checks**: "Is the Fjallraven Backpack in stock?" ‚Üí Inventory lookup.
- **Returns/Refunds**: Guided return process via dynamic forms.
- **RestockNotification**: Notify the customer when the product is back in stock
- **Rasa Integration**: NLP intents, entity extraction, and dialogue management.
- **Integrated LLM**: Integrated DeepSeek-R1 for Reasoning, i.e., to handle ambiguous queries and generate dynamic responses.
- **Mock Data**: No need for a real e-commerce backend.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
- **NLP & Dialogue**: Rasa (NLU + Core)
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL
- **Integrations**:
    FakeStore API (mock data),
    Shopify/Stripe API connections,
    Gmail/SMTP email automation
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS/Heroku
- **Frontend**: Streamlit with custom CSS design
- **LLM for Reasoning**: DeepSeek-R1
