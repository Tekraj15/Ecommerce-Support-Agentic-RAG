# Introduction
An AI-powered customer support agentic RAG for e-commerce, built with **Rasa** and **FakeStore API** as chatbot framework and e-commerce API respectively. Handles order tracking, product inquiries, and returns, with seamless integration for mock data.


# Why Agentic RAG for Medical Chatbot?

Current Limitations:
- Static Retrieval: One-and-done knowledge fetching
- No Reasoning: Cannot chain multiple retrievals for complex queries
- Limited Validation: Basic safety checks but no iterative verification
- Passive Architecture: Doesn't adapt retrieval strategy to query complexity

Agentic RAG Advantages:
- Multi-hop Reasoning: "What's the best medication for hypertension in elderly patients with diabetes?"
- Self-Correction: Detects insufficient information and requeries
- Dynamic Source Selection: Chooses between KB, APIs, or vector search based on context
- Verification Loops: Cross-references multiple sources for critical information

**Live Demo** (WIP):

## Features ‚ú®
- **Order Tracking**: "Where is my order #123?" ‚Üí Real-time status from FakeStore API.
- **Product Stock Checks**: "Is the Fjallraven Backpack in stock?" ‚Üí Inventory lookup.
- **Returns/Refunds**: Guided return process via dynamic forms.
- **RestockNotification**: Notify the customer when the product is back in stock
- **Rasa Integration**: NLP intents, entity extraction, and dialogue management.
- **Integrated LLM**: Integrated DeepSeek-R1 for Reasoning, i.e., to handle ambiguous queries and generate dynamic responses.
- **Mock Data**: No need for a real e-commerce backend.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
- **NLP & Dialogue**: Rasa (NLU + Core)
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL
- **Integrations**:
    FakeStore API (mock data),
    Shopify/Stripe API connections,
    Gmail/SMTP email automation
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS/Heroku
- **Frontend**: Streamlit with custom CSS design
- **LLM for Reasoning**: DeepSeek-R1
